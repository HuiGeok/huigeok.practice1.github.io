	<h1>Hello, I'm Hui Geok</h1>
    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>My name is Hui Geok, and I am currently an admin staff at a primary school, where I have developed strong organizational and communication skills over the past few years. Prior to this role, I worked in a completely different industry, which has broadened my professional experience.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy baking bread, which allows me to express my creativity and unwind. The process of crafting various bread recipes brings me joy and satisfaction.</p>
    
    <p>I am taking this course to learn new skills in digital communication and hope to make a successful career switch into this exciting field.
    </p>
